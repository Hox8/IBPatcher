- Basic Unreal Package deserialization, allowing mods to function on both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of the games (.json mods only)
- Full support for Coalesced encryption, decryption, and deserialization, allowing for distributable config file mods (.json mods only)
- Automatically unpacks required files from a zip/ipa, applies modifications, and repackages the archive
- Documentation for each mod format can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

## Usage
1. Once IBPatcher has been extracted, an .ipa or .zip file of an Infinity Blade game is required. You can fetch these and more from the [Infinity Blade Discord](https://discord.gg/S7jCh9N), or you can try grabbing a copy from [Archive.org](https://archive.org/). Drag and drop the downloaded game onto the patcher to create the required files.<br><br>
2. A large collection of community-made mods is available on a Google Drive folder available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1796Y97dCVlQMZpSiXQ1xh4ejHlNv50VO). More information can be found in #ibmodding-guide in the Infinity Blade Discord server<br><br>
3. Place the mods you downloaded into the appropriate mods folder generated earlier. You can now run the patcher to create a modded .ipa of the game.<br><br>
4. If you'd rather have the patcher output loose files instead, you can do that! Create a folder named 'Output' in the same directory and re-run the patcher. All modified files will be placed in the the Output folder<br>
